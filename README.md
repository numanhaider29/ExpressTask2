# ExpressTask2

This is JS expressed based app that uses restful APIs to perform all crud operations 
All of the requests like GET, PUT, POST and Delete are performed.
The working Of the APIs is checked using Postman Application that checks the integration
of all these Requests

Mainly this app will manage a student Record System and postman will be used as an endpoint
to use the app and access all the data.

Data is mainly a Student.js file consisting of array that has students in the form of the
objects and all of the manupilation.

I have created a index file with input fields to Add and display student records ...
all other operations are performed using postman software..
